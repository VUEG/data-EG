Please, find attached the list of species used for the megafauna map and, in the
archive, three shapefiles:

1. one for the mammals (over 10 kg)
2. one for the birds (over 5 kg)
3. one for both birds and mammals (this is slightly different from the megafauna
	 map I circulated with a previous draft of the chapter). I decided to send all
	 three because, firstly, the birds and the mammals data are in slightly
	 different grids so I guess there are different ways of bringing them
	 together. I did a union of the two initial maps (1)(2) and I obtained the
	 megafauna map (3).

Secondly, there are a few grid cells, mostly in the mammal map but some in the
bird map as well, which have no records and were likely not sampled. So for the
empty cells in the initial datasets, n the total megafauna map (3) I did an
average of the megamammals and megabirds species values of the neighboring cells
from (1) and (2) respectively. I thought this should be closer to reality than
having no values in those cells. Again, you might decide to deal differently
with this aspect. So I did the adjustment of values only in map (3).

I had to redo some aspects of the maps and because I didn't have access to
ArcGIS, I did this reprocessing with Quantum GIS and GRASS. Let me know if you
have any compatibility issues.

Regarding the data, both the datasets for mammals and birds were obtained by
writing official requests to the owners of the data, Societas Europaea
Mammalogica and the European Bird Census Council. The European Bird Census
Council is very keen on co-authorship of the outputs resulting from the use of
their data.

I hope this is clear and let me know if you have any further questions.
